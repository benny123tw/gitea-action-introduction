  In November 2019, GitHub Actions became generally available (GA), introducing matrix builds, live logs, and an ecosystem of shared actions.

  By GA, over 1,200 community-created Actions were on the Marketplace. GitHub also added features like self-hosted runners, artifact caching, and support for Linux, macOS, Windows, and ARM buildsâ€‹
